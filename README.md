## 🔎Project Overview

The Digital Content to Sign Language Converter is a comprehensive tool that converts various forms of Digital media (YouTube videos, local videos, audio files, and text) into sign language videos. This project leverages several libraries and APIs to process and translate spoken or written content into Indian Sign Language (ISL) syntax, creating videos that can aid in communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## 💡Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to bridge the communication gap for individuals who rely on sign language. By converting various media formats into sign language videos, we aim to provide an accessible and efficient means of understanding content that is traditionally available only in spoken or written form.

## Methodology 📝

### YouTube Video Processing 📽

1. *Download Audio:* Using yt-dlp, download the audio from the provided YouTube URL.
2. *Convert to Mono:* Ensure the audio is in mono format using pydub.
3. *Transcribe Audio:* Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio into text.
4. *Translate to ISL:* Convert the transcribed text to ISL syntax using nltk and Stanford Parser.
5. *Compile Video:* Use MoviePy to compile the translated text into a sign language video.

### Local File Processing 🎤

1. *Extract Audio:* Extract audio from the uploaded video or audio file using ffmpeg.
2. *Transcribe Audio:* Transcribe the extracted audio using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
3. *Translate to ISL:* Convert the transcribed text to ISL syntax.
4. *Compile Video:* Compile the translated text into a sign language video.

### Text Input Processing ✏

1. *Translate to ISL:* Directly convert the input text to ISL syntax.
2. *Compile Video:* Compile the translated text into a sign language video using appropriate video clips and GIFs.

# Setting Up Google Cloud Credentials and APIs for Speech-to-Text

## Prerequisites

1. *Google Cloud Account*: Ensure you have a Google Cloud account. If not, you can sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/).

2. *Google Cloud SDK*: Install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the project drop-down menu at the top of the page.
3. Click *New Project*.
4. Enter a name for your project.
5. Click *Create*.

## Step 2: Enable APIs

1. Go to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).
2. Search for *"Cloud Speech-to-Text API"*.
3. Click on the *"Cloud Speech-to-Text API"* result.
4. Click *Enable*.

## Step 3: Set Up Authentication

1. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page in the Cloud Console.
2. Click *Create credentials* and select *Service account*.
3. Enter a name for your service account and click *Create and continue*.
4. Assign the role *"Project" > "Editor"* and click *Continue*.
5. Click *Done*.
6. In the service account list, click on the newly created service account.
7. Click *Keys* and then *Add key* > *Create new key*.
8. Select *JSON* and click *Create*. Save the downloaded JSON file securely.

## Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud SDK

1. Open your terminal.
2. Initialize the Google Cloud SDK by running:
    sh
    gcloud init

3. Authenticate with your Google account and select your newly created project.
4. Set the environment variable to the path of your service account key file:
    sh
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON]"

    Replace [PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON] with the actual file path.
